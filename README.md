# cvxbook_additional_exercises
This repo contains additional exercises and data files in Python, Julia, and Matlab 
for the Stanford course [EE364a
(Convex Optimization)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/), that do not appear in the book 
[Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/).
Since 2022 the data files are only in Python.

It is updated after each quarter the course is taught, so the exercise numbers can change.

Instructors can request the solutions by emailing the authors.  Please
include a link to your course.
